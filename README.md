# Daily_Planner_and_Scheduler
This repo contains code that will be used to create a simple planner app that can add and save events to a calendar.
The current date will be displayed under the header when the page is opened, and the page will have a 9-5 time block to represent standard business hours. Each time block will be color coded to indicate a specific time group, namely Red for time block in the present, Green for future time blocks and Gray for past time blocks. There are text areas in each time block that can be saved by clicking on the save button next to them, and even after restarting the page or leaving it that saved text will still be there.
